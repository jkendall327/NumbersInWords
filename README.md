# Numbers in Words

Simple .NET 5 console app for converting digits to numerals (e.g. '5' to 'five') and vice versa ('seven hundred and two' to '702').

In real code I would just use [Humanizer](https://humanizr.net/), but I wanted to try out [this CodingDojo kata](https://codingdojo.org/kata/NumbersInWords/).
